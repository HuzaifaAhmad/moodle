 <h1>Biography: Shaykh Hashim</h1>
A former musician by profession, he grew up in Los Angeles, CA and spent his teenage years there during the 1960’s in pursuit of his musical career. During the same era the urge to acquire spiritual development and perfection continued to become more and more predominant until he realized that therein alone lay the secret of true success for man. He therefore left America in 1970 in pursuit of the true and pure path towards spiritual development and the real meaning and way of life as prescribed by the Creator of the universe in its original form. After extensive travel and search he finally accepted Islam in Ethiopia in 1971.

He eventually took admission at the Jami'ah Umm al-Qura in Makkah Mukarramah where he completed a degree from the Faculty of Da'wah wa Usul al-Din with specialization in the Sciences of Quran and Hadith. He thereafter was deputed by Shaykh ‘Abd al-'Aziz Bin Baz, then Chief Mufti of Saudi Arabia, as a teacher at Jami'at al-'Ulum al-Islamiyyah, Binnori Town, Karachi.

In 1997, he began to develop a company known as Al Khair Creative Quality Ware, based on Islamic and professional excellence which specializes in “beneficial products aligned with a healthy, meaningful lifestyle”. The Al Khair business model has evolved into an entire Islamic business system known as the Ubudiyyah Business Model. Shaykh Hashim now heads a team comprising of scholars and professionals who are involved in the research and development of the model and devotes a large portion of his time in further developing, presenting and sharing the UBM Model to the business community and others.

s:2756:"<h5><span style="color:rgb(51,51,51);font-size:14px;"></span></h5><div>Nakhlah Institute is an Islamic educational initiative 
with an aim to revive Islamic culture, character, and identity by 
educating women of all ages. Nakhlah strives to provide individuals with
 opportunities for traditional Islamic learning, designed with modern 
contexts and lifestyles in mind. Currently, there are three levels for 
teaching the Arabic Language, each with their own timings and levels of 
intensity, providing students a degree of flexibility in their quest for
 knowledge. We are continuing to expand our current programs, as well as
 initiate new programs and services for the benefit of the community.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>Nakhlah Institute's most recent project is Ta'leemul 
Fadā'il Wal Masā'il. This project offers brief audio sessions teaching 
the virtues of actions, short stories from the life of the Sahābah and 
Messenger ﷺ, the obligatory essentials of Fiqh, Ahādith,   and delivers 
them to the masses on a regular basis in three languages; Arabic, 
English, and Urdu.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>Through this project, Nakhlah strives to embody its 
description in the Quran. Allah mentions the Nakhlah tree in many places
 in the Quran for its benefits. Allah Most High states in Surah Ibrahim,
 verse 24-25: </div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>أَلَمْ تَرَ كَيْفَ ضَرَبَ اللَّهُ مَثَلًا كَلِمَةً طَيِّبَةً كَشَجَرَةٍ طَيِّبَةٍ أَصْلُهَا ثَابِتٌ وَفَرْعُهَا فِي السَّمَاءِ</div>
<div>تُؤْتِي أُكُلَهَا كُلَّ حِينٍ بِإِذْنِ رَبِّهَا ۗ وَيَضْرِبُ اللَّهُ الْأَمْثَالَ لِلنَّاسِ لَعَلَّهُمْ يَتَذَكَّرُونَ</div>
